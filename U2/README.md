 # Exercise 1: Annual tax
 ### Problem: Write a program that asks the user for their annual income and shows the corresponding tax on the screen

<div>

<div align= justify>

> ## INPUT

```c++ 
    // Request rent to the user
    cout << "Enter your annual income:" << endl;
    cin >> rent;
 ```
<div align= justify>

> ## PROCCESS

```c++ 
    // Assign with "if" the percentage of tax depending on the annual income
   if (rent >= 0 && rent < 10000)
    {
        tax = .05;
    }
    else if (rent >= 10000 && rent < 20000)
    {
        tax = .15;
    }
    else if (rent >= 20000 && rent < 35000)

    }
    else
    {
        cout << "Invalid rent" << endl;
    }

 ```
<div align= justify>

> ## OUTPUT

        // Print the results
        cout << "Your tax will be a percentage of " << (tax * 100) << "%" << endl;
        cout << "Your tax will be $" << rent * tax << endl;
    }
```  

<div>

<div align= justify>

## Explanation 

1.	Input

    1.1. The program will ask the user how much for rent annually.

    1.2. The user will enter how much he pays rent annually.
2.	Process 

    2.1. With a series of "if's" the program will determine the percentage of rent that the user must pay if the amount of rent payment is $ 0 or more.
    
    2.3. If the amount of rent that the user enters does not enter the rengo of $ 0 or more the program through a "else" will show the message "Invalide rent".
3.	Output 
    
    3.1. By means of an "If" the program will determine if it should show the result of the total tax if the user entered a valid amount.
    
    3.2. Within the above "if" the program will calculate the final tax.
    
    3.3. The program will print the final tax.

## Explanation 

1. Entrance
    
    1.1. The program will ask the user how many items he will buy by means of a "do while" cycle.
    
    1.2. The user enters will go the number of products he will buy 
    
    1.3. The user will enter the individual price of the product 
2. Process 
    
    2.1. The program through "If's" will determine if the user wants to continue entering products, if he wishes the program will ask the individual price of the product and multiply it by the number of products he has entered.
    
    2.2. The program will add up the total of all purchases.
    
    2.3. If the user enters a "0" in the number of products he compares, the program will exit the "do while" cycle.
    
    2.4. If the user enters a negative number in the number of products compared by the program, it will indicate that the number entered is an invalid amount. 
3. Exit 
    
    3.1. The program prints the total purchase.
